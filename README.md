# Beat-Sharer

Ability to share songs through the usage of one-click codes on ModAssistant.

# Saver Usage

Place the executable in the your "Beat Saber/Beat Saber_Data/CustomLevels/" folder and run.
This will generate "codes.bshr" file which can be used to send to friends or keep as a backup.

# Downloader Usage

Place a "codes.bshr" file in the same folder as the downloader and run. 
This will begin a series of one-click installs for all the songs.

## Recommendation

In ModAssistant change the one-click install window to hide or close. 
For this to take effect you must turn off one-click, change the option, then reenable one-click installs.

## Note

The songs are limited to download at 1 song per second. This is reduce concurrent downloads. 
You can further limit it by opening the "codes.bshr" file and removing some of the codes. 
Repeating this a few times will get all the songs.
Additionally, the downloader will skip already downloaded songs.
