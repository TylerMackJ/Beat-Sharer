# Beat-Sharer

Ability to share songs through the usage of one-click codes on ModAssistant.

# Saver Usage

1. Place the executable in the your "Beat Saber/Beat Saber_Data/CustomLevels/" folder and run.
1. This will generate a UID for you which you should tell to your friends to download songs.

# Downloader Usage

1. Place the executable in the your "Beat Saber/Beat Saber_Data/CustomLevels/" folder and run.
1. Provide a friends UID to begin downloading their songs.

## Recommendation

In ModAssistant change the one-click install window to hide or close.
* For this to take effect you must turn off one-click, change the option, then reenable one-click installs.


## Notes

* There are a limited number of UIDs so your songs will be avaible until someone ends up generating the same UID. This should take quite a while until userbase grows.
* The songs are limited to download at 1 song per second. This is reduce concurrent downloads. 
* The downloader will skip already downloaded songs.
